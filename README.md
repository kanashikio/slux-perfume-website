# Final OJT Project - Perfume Shop Landing Page

## Project Overview

This is my final project for my On-the-Job Training (OJT) where I designed and developed a **landing page for a perfume shop**. 
The page is built using **Bootstrap** for the layout and styling, and **Mustache.js** as the templating system to manage dynamic content rendering. 
The landing page also features **animations** to enhance user experience and engagement.

## Features

- **Animations**: Added smooth animations to highlight product features and improve the visual appeal of the site.
- **Mustache.js Templating**: Used Mustache.js to handle dynamic rendering of content, making it easier to update and manage different sections of the page.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Leveraged Bootstrap's grid system and components for a clean, modern layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Mustache.js**
- **JavaScript**
